#Wildlife-Rescue-Automation-System

Developed a Java application, complemented with a UML design and JUnit tests, to streamline daily volunteer tasks, focusing on efficient animal care. The system prioritizes fixed-time tasks like medical treatments and then intelligently groups similar flexible tasks, such as feeding, within specified time-windows. Integrated with a MySQL database using the MySQLConnector, it fetches and updates real-time animal care requirements. It dynamically allocates tasks based on their duration and the number of available volunteers, reducing manual scheduling errors and ensuring timely care for all animals. The program also has a feature to call backup volunteers when essential to complete overlapping tasks, with an emphasis on preventing volunteer burnout.
